# Traffic sign detection 

This repository presents a code to detect the traffic lights using CNNs. The dataset consists of road images with traffic lights showing different signals. The labels are given in a .YAML file. We ahve four labels RED,GREEN, Yellow and None.

Test Accuracy - approx 70%
Simple CNN trained on BOSCH tracffic light dataset.

We can improve this accuracy by training a deeper network and also by using a better model such as RCNN for bounding box detection too.
